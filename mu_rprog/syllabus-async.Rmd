\section{I. Course Info}

Welcome to R Programming!

\subsection{A. Learning Objectives and Outcomes}

In this course, we'll explore the basic building blocks of statistical programming in R.

The course focuses on three parallel learning objectives

* setting up an open-source software environment for practicing data science
* translation of ideas to software solutions using R
* management and sharing of code

There will of course be some time spent learning syntax (e.g. "this is the command to do this thing in R"), but you'll also get the opportunity to hit each of these learning objectives through quizzes, programming assignments, a flexibly-defined final project and (finally) a "code review" presentation of your work.

The R ecosystem is huge and there are new features being added daily. You will not learn all or even most of what the language has to offer in this course, but you will leave with enough knowledge to hack together solutions to data-rich problems in your academic and professional lives.

**Required Textbooks:**

None :)

**Lecture Videos:**

Pre-recorded lecture videos are hosted on my Google Drive, at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gxLk7hH5sPd8QaBwKY9QqabyWq3TXoAh.

All lecture videos are available as of the first day of class.
Videos describing the solutions to quizzes and assignments will be made available after the deadlines for those items.

**Required Hardware:**

\textcolor{red}{You are required to use your own laptop for this class.} If you do not have a personal laptop, please let me know as soon as possible.

The use of personal hardware is required because one of the objectives for this course is to help each of you set up a data science development environment on your own machines.

**Required Software:**

We will be working with the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/).
For script editing and exploratory analysis, we'll use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

Instructions for setting up these components can be found in the section below.

**Slides and Assignment Rubrics:**

Slides and assignment rubrics are available both in the "Content" section of the course page on D2L and on the course [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jameslamb/teaching/tree/main/mu_rprog).

\subsection{C. To-Do Before the First Session}

The course begins on 6/5/2023.

Before that date, please do the following:

**1. Take the pre-course survey on [d2l](https://d2l.mu.edu/)**

The survey must be completed before the first day of class.
This is just to help me understand your previous experience with programming and data science.

**2. Set up your development environment**

- Try to [install R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) on your personal laptop
- Try to [install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) on your personal laptop

I hope you'll be able to install these components using the information at those links and some moderate Googling.
If you run into any issues, please email me and I'll help you out.

\subsection{A. Quizzes (25\%)}

There will be two quizzes which will test your understanding of topics covered in class.
These quizzes will test your knowledge of terminology and core concepts.
In addition, quizzes may require you to interpret pseudo-code or to write a bit of R code yourself to solve questions.

Quizzes will be delivered online via D2L (see the "Quizzes" section of the course site).
Quizzes have no time limit.
You will be allowed two attempts for each quiz and your grade on each quiz will be the better of your two scores.
All times below are in Central Time.

|Quiz                       |Opens                             |Due                         |

\subsection{B. Programming Assignments (30\%)}

After we've covered preliminary topics in the first two weeks of the course, I'll ask you to complete two programming assignments.
In these assignments, you'll create R scripts to accomplish common tasks in data exploration and statistical analysis.

Assignment rubrics can be found under the "Programming Assignments" module in the "Content" section of the course D2L page.

Your completed assignment must be uploaded to the appropriate folder in the "Dropbox" section on the course D2L page by the due date listed in the table below.
All times below are in Central Time.

|Programming Assignment 2   | 11:00p on July 1, 2023      |

\subsection{C. Final Project (45\%)}

Unlike the quizzes and programming assignments, the final project will be relatively unstructured.
In this project, you will be asked to augment what you've learned about base R with other functionality available in external packages.
You will be responsible for building an end-to-end analysis in R...a script that gets/cleans real world data, creates some exploratory plots, executes some statistical analysis, and stores the results to a file for later re-use.

The project comprises four parts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Final project proposal}: A 1-2 page briefing on your planned project
    \item \emph{Final project script}: The R script/scripts supporting your project
    \item \emph{Final project report}: A 2-4 page report detailing the outcome of your analysis
    \item \emph{Final project code review}: A 5-10 minute overview of your project, presented live in the final week of the course.
    \item \emph{Final Project peer review}: Written feedback for three of your classmates' presentations.
\end{enumerate}

Full details of the project and each of its components are available at [https://jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/assignments/final_project.html](https://jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/assignments/final_project.html).
All times below are in Central Time.

|Assignment                      |Due                     |

|Final Project (script + report) | 11:00p on July 8, 2023 |
|Final Project code review video | 11:00p on July 8, 2023 |
|Final Project peer reviews      | 11:00p on July 8, 2023 |

\subsection{D. Extra Credit}

There is an optional Extra Credit assignment available, worth up to 3 percentage points on your final grade.
Follow the instructions at https://jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/assignments/extra-credit.html.

This extra credit must be submitted prior to midnight on July 15, 2023.

\subsection{E. Grade Appeal}

The grading policies described above will be used to calculate your final grade for the course
Individual assignment grades will follow rubrics available on the D2L site for this course.
If you disagree with any grade assigned to you in this course, please frame all appeals in the language of this document + those rubrics.

\section{III. Administrative Information}

\subsection{A. Special Needs}

Please inform me during the first week of class if you have any conditions that may limit or affect your ability to participate in this course so that we can make necessary arrangements.
You may also contact the Office of Student Disability Services (http://www.marquette.edu/disability-services/).

\subsection{B. Emergency Plan}

Every Marquette University campus building has emergency shelter and evacuation plans.
Please familiarize yourself with the plans of each building in which you take classes or attend meetings.
Make sure to note the routes to the lowest level of the buildings for shelter during inclement weather, as well as exits from the buildings in the event of fire or other emergency.

\subsection{C. Attendance Statement}

The Marquette University Graduate School of Management considers regular class attendance an important component of the learning process.
Students are expected to attend scheduled class meetings; excessive absences may have adverse consequences, ranging from a lowered course grade to forced withdrawal from the course.
Excessive absence is generally defined as missing more than 10-15 percent of the regularly scheduled class time.

For this course, anything more than 1 class period is determined to be "excessive".
Because this is a short (5-week) course, missing even one week will make it difficult to learn the material and satisfactorily complete the course requirements.
If you miss more than one class, your grade will be reduced by a full letter grade for each absence after the first.
All students are expected to complete all quizzes, assignments, and the final project.

The policy above applies to "unexcused" absences.
There are a handful of situations which are considered "excused" absences:

\begin{itemize}
    \item absences resulting from legal obligations (such as jury duty)
    \item absences resulting from university-sanctioned activities and related travel
    \item absences resulting from religious observance
\end{itemize}

If you anticipate missing any classes, please let me know as early as possible so we can plan accordingly.

\subsection{D. Academic Integrity}

Don't cheat. For more see http://www.marquette.edu/provost/integrity-pledge.php.

**DEFINITIONS OF ACADEMIC DISHONESTY**

Academic dishonesty applies equally to electronic media and print and involves text, images and ideas.
It includes but is not limited to the following examples:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cheating}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Copying from others during an examination.
        \item Communicating exam answers with other students during an examination.
        \item Offering another person's work as one's own.
        \item Taking an examination for another student or having someone take an examination for oneself.
        \item Sharing answers for a take-home exam or assignment unless specifically authorized by the instructor.
        \item Tampering with an examination after it has been corrected and then returning it for more credit.
        \item Using unauthorized materials during an examination.
        \item Allowing others to do the research and writing of an assigned paper (including use of the services of a commercial term-paper company).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dishonest Conduct}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stealing or attempting to steal an examination or answer key from the instructor.
        \item Changing or attempting to change academic records without proper sanction.
