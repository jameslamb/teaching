<h2>Course Objectives</h2>

In this 5-week course, we are going to install a bunch of software and read/write a bunch of R code.

<br>
The main objectives for the course are as follows:

* Set up a data science software stack on your machine
* Learn how to author and manage a statistical code base
* Learn the basics of manipulating data using R
* Learn how to incorporate external packages to make your scripts more powerful
* Practice solving problems in R and presenting solutions in a code review format

<h2>Installing R + RStudio</h2>

Programming in R begins with installing R!

* Go to https://cran.r-project.org/
* Choose the appropriate download for your operating system (you'll see links like "Download R for Mac OS")
* Open the file and follow the prompts on the screen

R comes with a command-line client and a default GUI, but most users prefer to use other IDEs (*"integrated development environment"*). The most popular IDE for R, and the one we'll use in this class, is RStudio:

* Go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
* Choose the appropriate download under "All Installers"
* Open the file and follow the prompts on the screen

<h2>Authoring Scripts in RStudio</h2>

Sequences of R code are typically saved in scripts with the file extension ".R". To open a blank script in RStudio and start editing, you can either go to "File --> New File --> R script" or choose "R Script" from the paper image in RStudio:

<h2>Installing Sublime Text</h2>

The world of data science is a world of text files...of many types. For working with other types of text files (e.g. config files, queries, JSON data, READMEs, and more), you'll want to install a full-featured text editor. One possibility is [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), but you are welcome to use whatever works for you.

"Full-featured" text editors do far more than provide a simple window for entering basic text.

**Example features**

* [syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting)
* [syntax validation](https://www.google.com/search?q=syntax+validation)
* [pretty printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prettyprint)
* [code execution](https://realpython.com/blog/python/setting-up-sublime-text-3-for-full-stack-python-development/)
* [tab completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion)

<h2>Authoring Scripts in a Text Editor</h2>

When you author a script in RStudio, the file you create will be stored with the file extension ".R" by default. Out in the wild (i.e. editing in text editors), you are responsible for saving files with the appropriate file extension so the software that uses them can interpret them correctly. Trust me, there are [a lot of them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_formats)

A few common ones you'll want to know for this course:

*** =left

**Scripts and Docs**

- General text files (.md, .txt)
- R scripts (.R, .r)
- SQL queries (.sql)
- Slides and reports (.css, .html, .pdf, .rmd)

*** =right

**Data**

- API response data (.csv, .json, .xml)
- R data formats (.rda, .rds, .RData)
- MS Excel (.xls, .xlsx, .xlsm)
- Zip archives (.zip, .tar, .gz, .bzip2)

<h2>Executing R Code: RStudio</h2>

R is an [interpreted language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language) (more on this later). TL;DR, you need to send your code to some software that knows what to do with it ("R"). RStudio makes this super easy to do. You can execute your code interactively (one line at a time) in the R console or run your .R scripts using the "run" button.

<h2>Executing R Code: The Command Line</h2>

When R is just one of the tools in your stack, it's often quicker to execute your code from a terminal rather than going into a dedicated application for each type of file.

**The R REPL**

- R comes with a REPL ([read-eval-print loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)) which allows you to quickly turn a terminal command line into an R console.
- To activate: `R` from the command line
- To close: `quit()` or `q()`

**Rscript**

- If your commands are stored in a ".R" script, you can execute that script from the command line with the `Rscript` command.
- This command will run all the lines in the file in the order they've been written and potentially output some messages to the terminal.

<h2>R is an Interpreted Language</h2>

Interpreted languages are those which break commands down into building blocks called "subroutines" that have already been compiled in machine code (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language)). Much of the R source code (including these subroutines) is actually written in C.

To ensure that that process of breaking down ("interpreting") code goes smoothly, R needs to use a few keywords to identify crucial operations. Like other scripting languages, it has a set of "reserved words" which you cannot use as object names.
<br><br>

**Run `?reserved` in RStudio**

**Run `TRUE = 4` in RStudio**

<h2>R is a Dynamically Typed Language</h2>

- Some languages like Java required you to declare the **types** of objects you create
    - for example: string, numeric, integer, or boolean
    - pros: strong typing makes software faster and more reliable (broadly speaking)
    - cons: code is very verbose, difficult to prototype in and debug

- R is "dynamically typed"
    - this means that you can create objects without explicitly telling R "this is an integer"
    - in addition, you're free to re-assign variable names to different types at any time in scripts

<h2>R has its own File Types</h2>

|Extension    |Description                                                        |
|:-----------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------:|
|.r, .R       | Text format for scripts.                                          |
|.rda, .RData | R data format. One or many R objects                              |
|.rds         | R data format. Single R object. Can be loaded into a named object |
<br>

```{r fileTypes, eval = FALSE}
# .r and .R scripts can be run inside R with source()
source("my_script.R")

# .rda and .RData files can be loaded into an R session with load()
load("all_of_the_data.rda")

# .rds files can be read directly into an R object
someData <- readRDS("my_data.rds")

<h2>Variables and Namespaces</h2>

When you execute a statement like `x <- 5` in R, you are creating an **object** in memory which holds the numeric **value** 5 and is referenced by the **variable name** "x".

If you later ask R to do something like `y <- x + 2`, it will search through a series of **namespaces** until it finds a variable called "x". Namespaces can be thought of as collections of labels pointing to places in memory. You can use R's `search()` command to examine the ordered list of namespaces that R will search in for variables.

```{r namespaces, eval = FALSE}
# Check the search path of namespaces
search()

# use ls() to list the objects in one of those namespaces
ls("package:stats")
```

<h2>Introduction to Types</h2>

Languages like Java and C are more verbose than R partially because they require programmers to explicitly declare *types* for data values. We will not go into the intricacy of typing in this course, but you should be familiar with the following types (this knowledge will serve you well across all languages):

- *integer*: non-complex whole numbers. created with an L like `anInteger <- 1L`
- *numeric*: all real numbers. Default type for numbers in R `someNums <- c(1.005, 2)`
- *logical*: TRUE or FALSE. `someLogicals <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)`
- *character*: strings of arbitrary characters. Sometimes referred to informally as "text data". `stringVar <- "Chicago Heights"`

<h2>Controlling Program Flow: If-Else</h2>

Soon after you start writing code (in any language), you'll find yourself saying "I only want to do this thing if certain conditions are met". This type of logic is expressed using [if-else syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming))

<br>

```{r ifElse1, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
x <- 4
if (x > 5){
    print("x is above the threshold")
}
```

See the [Week 1 Code Supplement](jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/code/Week1_Supplement.html) for more examples.

<h2>Controlling Program Flow: If-Else</h2>

What if you want to express more than two possible outcomes? For this, we could use R's `else if` construct to nest conditions. Note that conditional blocks can have any number of "else if" statements, but only one "else" block.

```{r ifElse2, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Try to think through what this will do before you run it yourself:
if (4 > 5){
    print("3")
} else if (6 <= (5/10)) {
    print("1")
} else if (4 + 4 + 4 == 12.0001) {
    print("4")
} else {
    print("2")
}
```

<h2>Controlling Program Flow: For Loops</h2>

One of the most powerful characteristics of general purpose programming languages is their ability to automate repetitive tasks. When you know that you want to do something a fixed number of times (say, squaring each item in a vector), you can use a `for` loop.

```{r forLoop, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create a vector
x <- c(1,4,6)

# Print the square of each element one at a time
print(1^2)
print(4^2)
print(6^2)

# BETTER: Loop over the vector and print the square of each element
for (some_number in x){
    print(some_number^2)
}
```

<h2>Controlling Program Flow: While Loops (pt 1)</h2>

For loops are suitable for many applications, but they can be too restrictive in some cases. For example, imagine that you are writing a simple movie search engine and you want to tell R "look through an alphabetized list of movies and tell me if you find Apocalypse Now". A `for` loop can certainly do this, but it will keep running over ALL movies...long after it finds Ace Ventura! This is a great place to use a `while` loop.

Consult the [Week 1 Code Supplement](jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/code/Week1_Supplement.html) for the `for` loop implementation to solve this problem.

<h2>Controlling Program Flow: While Loops (pt 2)</h2>

The `while` loop implementation can be found in the [Week 1 Code Supplement](jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/code/Week1_Supplement.html). Notice that it stops checking once it finds what it wants, making it potentially more efficient than the `for` implementation.

<h2>Intro to Functional Programming</h2>

R is a [functional programming language](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html). To write powerful, concise code, you'll need to master the use and creation of functions.

> "If you find yourself copying and pasting the same code more than twice, it's time to write a function." - Hadley Wickham


```{r functionExample, eval = FALSE}
# Function to return only the even numbers from a vector
answers <- c(1, 3, 4, 8, 13, 24)

getEvens <- function(some_numbahs){
    the_evens <- some_numbahs[some_numbahs %% 2 == 0]
    return(the_evens)
}

getEvens(answers)
```

  <script>FooterBubbles(2,4)</script>V. Functions in R<span style="float:right">ECON 6114 - R Programming</span>
</footer>

<h2>Required Arguments</h2>

- R functions take 0 or more arguments...basically named variables that the function uses to do it's work
- Take a look at `?sqrt`. You'll see that it takes one argument, named `x`. You can pass any vector of numeric values to this argument and `sqrt` will return the square root of each element
- In this case, we'd say `x` is a *required argument* of `sqrt`

```{r requiredArgs, eval = FALSE}
# Take the square root of a vector of numbers
sqrt(x = c(1,4,9,16,25))

# Note that calling this function without the argument will throw an error!
sqrt()
### Error in sqrt(): 0 arguments passed to `sqrt` which requires 1
```

</footer>

<h2>Default Argument Values</h2>

- For more complicated functions, passing values to each argument can get burdensome
- To handle this, R allows function authors to specify *default arguments*. These are values that certain arguments will take automatically unless you decide to overwrite them
- Example: look at `?rnorm`. You'll see that this function's signature reads `rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)`.

```{r normalDraw}
# 100 random draws from a normal distribution w/ mean 0 and standard deviation 1
rand_nums <- rnorm(n = 100)

# 100 random draws from a normal distribution w/ mean 4.5 and standard deviation 1
rand_nums <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 4.5)
```

<h2>User-Defined Functions</h2>

As you saw in the last example, R gives you the ability to define your own functions on the fly for an added level of flexibility. Mastering this technique takes time, but if you can get it you'll be able to do some really powerful stuff. We'll spend more time on functions in the following weeks, but here's a sneak peak of what is possible:

<h2>Vectors (pt 1)</h2>

- Because R was designed for use with statistics, most of its operations are [vectorized](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1112/2016sp/Exams/exam2/vectorizedCode.pdf)
- You can create vectors a few ways:

```{r vectors_pt1, eval = FALSE}
# Ordered sequence of integers
1:5

# Counting by 2s
seq(from = 0, to = 14, by = 2)

# Replicate the same values
rep(TRUE, 6)

# Concatenate multiple values with the "c" operator
c("all", "of", "the", "lights")
```

<h2>Vectors (pt 2)</h2>

- Vectors are at the heart of many R operations. Try a few more practice exercises:

```{r vectors_pt2, eval = FALSE}
# Watch out! Mixing types will lead to silent coercion
c(1, TRUE, "hellos")

# Some functions, when applied over a vector, return a single value
is.numeric(rnorm(100))

# Others will return a vector of results
is.na(c(1, 5, 10, NA, 8))

# Vectors can be named
batting_avg <- c(youkilis = 0.300, ortiz = 0.355, nixon = 0.285)

# You can combine two vectors with c()
x <- c("a", "b", "c")
y <- c("1", "2", "3")
c(x, y)
```

<h2>Lists (pt 1)</h2>

Vectors are the first multi-item data structure all R programmers learn. Soon, though, you may find yourself frustrated with the fact that they can only hold a single type. To handle cases where you want to package multiple types (and even multiple objects!) together, we will turn to a data structure called a `list`.

|Capabilities                        |Vectors |Lists   |
|:----------------------------------:|:------:|:------:|
|Optional use of named elements      |&#x2714;|&#x2714;|
|Support math operations like mean() |&#x2714;|        |
|Hold multiple types                 |        |&#x2714;|
|Hold multiple objects               |        |&#x2714;|


```{r lists_pt1, eval = FALSE}
# Create a list with list()
myList <- list(a = 1, b = rep(TRUE, 10), x = c("shakezoola", "mic", "rulah"))

# Examine it with str()
str(myList)
```

<h2>Lists (pt 2)</h2>

We saw earlier how you can use `for` loops to walk over a vector and do something with each element. You can certainly do the same thing with a list, but it can be a bit tedious.
```{r listLoop}
# Create a list
studentList <- list(kanye = c(80, 90, 100), talib = c(95, 85, 99), common = c(100, 100, 99))

# Get average grades with a for loop
grades <- vector(mode = "list", length = 3)
for (i in 1:length(studentList)){
    grades[[i]] <- mean(studentList[[i]])
}
```
Luckily, R provides a built-in function called `lapply()` to handle this more expressively. We'll cover R's [apply family of functions](https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-tutorial-on-the-apply-family-of-functions/) later in the course. Here's a sneak peek:
```{r listLapply}
grades <- lapply(studentList, mean)
```

<h2>Data Frames (pt 1)</h2>

Vectors and lists are crucial data structures in R, but you may find that they're difficult to work with in model training and other data science tasks. It is now time to introduce a third foundational data structure: the data frame.

Data frames are tables of data. Each column of a data frame can be a different type, but all values within a column must be the same type.

```{r dataFrame, eval = FALSE}
# Create a data frame!
myDF <- data.frame(
    time_period  = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    , temperature  = c(25.6, 38.7, 31.4, 40.0, 29.20)
    , station      = c("A", "B", "A", "A", "B")
    , is_gov_owned = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
)

# Check out the structure of this thing
str(myDF)
```

<h2>Data Frames (pt 2)</h2>

R comes with some sample data sets you can experiment with. Let's load the `mtcars` data.frame and test out some new commands!

```{r dateFrame2, eval = FALSE}
# Load the mtcars data frame
data("mtcars")

# Check out its structure
str(mtcars)

# View the top 10 rows
head(mtcars, n = 10) # could use "tail" for the bottom 10

# Find all the unique values of "cyl" (the number of engine cylinders)
unique(mtcars$cyl)
```

<h2>Data Frames (pt 3)</h2>

We will be working with data frames throughout this class, given their importance to data science and statistics. A more thorough treatment of this data structure will be given in Week 2. For now, I'd like to introduce you to one more looping function: `apply`.

`apply` allows you to loop over the rows or columns of a data frame and execute an arbitrary function. The code below holds some examples of what can be accomplished with `apply`.

```{r apply_on_a_DF, eval = FALSE}
# Get the mean of each column
apply(mtcars, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean)

# Get the mean of each row (nonsensical, just illustrating
apply(mtcars, MARGIN = 1, FUN = mean)
```
