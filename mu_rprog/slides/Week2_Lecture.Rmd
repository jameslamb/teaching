<h2>Quiz 1 Review</h2>

I will show the questions from quiz 1 that a lot of students struggled with. Not including them in these slides in case I teach the course again in the future.

If you're arriving at this slide and are disappointed not to find quiz answers, I'm sorry but I'll at least give you this bit of entertainment. Go check out [A Day in the Life of Americans](https://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/)

<h2>Looping with lapply</h2>

R's `*apply` family of functions are a bit difficult to understand at first, but soon you'll come to love them. They make your code more expressive, flexible, and parallelizable (more on that final point later). One of the most popular is `lapply` ("list apply"), which loops over a thing (e.g. vector, list) and returns a 1-level list. Let's try it out:

```{r lapplyExample, eval = FALSE}
data("ChickWeight")
weights <- ChickWeight$weight

# Loop over and encode "above mean" and "below mean"
the_mean <- mean(weights)
meanCheck <- function(val, ref_mean){
    if (val > ref_mean){return("above mean")}
    if (val < ref_mean){return("below mean")}
    return("equal to the mean")
}
check_vec <- lapply(weights, FUN = function(x){meanCheck(val = x, ref_mean = the_mean)})
```

<h2>Looping with sapply</h2>

On the previous slide, you saw how to loop over a vector/list and get back a list of function results. This may not be appropriate for some settings. Remember that you cannot execute statistical operations like `mean()` over a list. For that, we'd probably prefer to have a *vector* of results. This is where R's `sapply()` ("simplified apply") comes in. `sapply()` works the same way that `lapply()` does but returns a vector. Try it for yourself:

```{r sapplyExample, eval = FALSE}
data("ChickWeight")
weights <- ChickWeight$weight

# Loop over and encode "above mean" and "below mean"
the_mean <- mean(weights)
meanCheck <- function(val, ref_mean){
    if (val > ref_mean){return("above mean")}
    if (val < ref_mean){return("below mean")}
    return("equal to the mean")
}
check_vec <- sapply(weights, FUN = function(x){meanCheck(val = x, ref_mean = the_mean)})
```

<h2>Looping with apply</h2>

When analyzing real-world datasets, you may want to use the same looping convention we've been discussing, but apply it over many items and the get some summary (such as the median) of the results. This is where R's `apply()` function comes in! Check it out

```{r applyExample, eval = FALSE}
data("ChickWeight")

# Calculate column-wise range
apply(ChickWeight, MARGIN = 2, FUN = function(x){range(as.numeric(x))})

# Calculate row-wise range
apply(ChickWeight, MARGIN = 1, FUN = function(blah){range(as.numeric(blah))})
```

<h2>Subsetting Vectors</h2>

**Subsetting** is the act of retrieving a portion of an object, usually based on some logical condition (e.g. "all elements greater than 5"). In R, this is done with the `[` operator.

```{subset_vecs}
# Create a vector to work with
myVec <- c(var1 = 10, var2 = 15, var3 = 20, av4 = 6)

# "the first element"
myVec[1]

# "second to fourth elements"
myVec[2:4]

# "the element named var3"
myVec["var3"]
```

    <script>FooterBubbles(2,4)</script>II. Subsetting<span style="float:right">ECON 6114 - R Programming</span>
</footer>

<h2>Subsetting Lists</h2>

Lists, arbitrary collections of (potentially heterogeneous) R objects, are subsetted a bit differently than vectors. If you use `[` with a list, you are guaranteed to get back another list. If you use `[[`, you will get back an object in its natural form (whatever it would look like if it wasn't in the list). You can also use `$` to access named elements.

Please see the [Week 2 Programming Supplement](https://jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/code/Week2_Supplement.html) for some examples of list subsetting.

<h2>Subsetting Data Frames</h2>

Data frames are the workhorse data structure of statistics in R. The best way to learn data frame subsetting is to just walk through the examples below:

```{r subsetDF, eval = FALSE}
# Create a data frame
someDF <- data.frame(
    , conference  = c("Big East", "Big Ten", "Big East", "ACC", "SEC")
    , school_name = c("Villanova", "Minnesota", "Marquette", "Duke", "LSU")
    , wins        = c(18, 14, 19, 24, 12)
    , ppg         = c(71.5, 45.8, 66.9, 83.4, 58.7)
)

# Grab the wins column (NOTE: will give you back a vector)
someDF[, "wins"]

# Grab the first 3 rows and the two numeric columns
someDF[1:3, c("wins", "ppg")]
```

<h2>Using Logical Vectors</h2>

So far, we've seen how to subset R objects using numeric indices and named elements. These are useful approaches, but both require you to know something about the contents of the object you're working with.

Using these methods (especially numeric indices like saying *give me columns 2-4*) can make your code confusing and hard for others to reason about. Wherever possible, I strongly recommend using logical vectors for subsetting. This makes your code intuitive and more flexible to change.

Please see the [Week 2 Programming Supplement](https://jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/code/Week2_Supplement.html) for a treatment of subsetting with logical vectors.

<h2>Print Debugging</h2>

As you've probably already learned, writing code involves a never-ending process of trying this, fixing errors, trying other things, fixing new errors, etc. The process of identifying and fixing errors/bugs is called **debugging**.

The simplest way to debug an issue in your code is to use **print debugging**. This approach involves forming expectations about the state of the objects in your environment at each point in your code, then printing those states at each point to find where things broke.

Please see the [Week 2 Programming Supplement](https://jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/code/Week2_Supplement.html) for and example of this approach.

<h2>Googling Around (continued)</h2>

But really...Google is your best friend. It will be particularly useful in the cases where your code is returning an error or warning. Simple pasting that output into google (in quotes to get an exact match) will typically get you to an answer within 5 minutes.

Let's try an example.

<br>

Imagine that you got this error:

`Error in sum(c(1, 2, "5")) : invalid 'type' (character) of argument`.

Try to figure out what went wrong. HINT: it often helps to type the function name outside quotes. e.g. `function "this is some error text"`

<h2>Building an MWE</h2>

If print debugging doesn't work, you may want to ask someone (a colleague, a package author, your teach) for help in debugging the issue. Before asking for someone's help, you owe it to them to try to reduce the problem to a **Minimum Working Example (MWE)**, the simplest possible code that reproduces the error.

* [this is bad](https://github.com/uptake/uptasticsearch/issues/140)
* [this is good](https://github.com/uptake/pkgnet/issues/70)

<br>

In many instances, you'll find that just doing this exercise will reveal the problem before you even have to ask for anyone's help.

<br>

<h2>Built-in Docs with "?"</h2>

As we've covered before, R packages have a built-in documentation system. All packages submitted to CRAN must supply some basic documentation for each function they contain. If a function is behaving strangely, it's often useful to look at the documentation under `?function_name`.

For example, you may be surprised to learn that `sum(c(1,2,NA,3))` evaluates to `NA`. You might have thought it would be 6. If we call `?sum` in R, you'll see the answer...the default behavior of this function is to leave `NA` values in when calculating the sum, but there is an option argument `na.rm` that allows you to remove them if you wish.

Many IDEs (including RStudio) offer automatic [code completion](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/205273297-Code-Completion) that will suggest these other arguments in the UI as you type!

<h2>Package Vignettes</h2>

So far, we've talked about cases where you know exactly which functions are behaving strangely and want to just learn more about their behavior. But what about fuzzier cases where you just want to figure out what other functionality a package has? At least one source for this information is the package vignettes.

Let's take a look at the online documentation for the `stringr` package:

- CRAN docs: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/index.html
- package vignette: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/stringr.pdf

<h2>Looking at Source Code</h2>

If you try all the strategies we just discussed and STILL don't know why your code isn't working, there is at least one option left to you: look at the source code! Recall the following facts:

- R is open-source, which means that all R source code can be found online (typically on GitHub) and visually inspected
- Errors thrown by programs are not magical...they had to be written into the source code by a developer

For example, let's search for the error: `ggplot2 doesn't know how to deal with data of class integer` in the ggplot2 source code. Please visit:

https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2

<h2>Loading Installed Packages</h2>

In week 1, we discussed R functions, packages, and namespaces. As you advance in R, you will find that the functions provided by packages like `base`, `stats`, and `utils` are not sufficient. For example, you may want to use `rbokeh` to make interactive plots.

```{r makePlots, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Load dependencies
library(data.table); library(quantmod); library(rbokeh); library(purrr);

# Get data and plot it
quantmod::getSymbols('CPIAUCSL', src = 'FRED')
cpiDT <- data.table::data.table(CPIAUCSL, keep.rownames = TRUE)

# Plot it!
rbokeh::figure(data = cpiDT, title = "U.S. CPI",
               ylab = "Index (1982-1984 = 100)", xlab = "date") %>%
        ly_lines(x = cpiDT$index, y = cpiDT$CPIAUCSL, color = "blue")
```

<h2>Installing from CRAN</h2>

**[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)**, "The Comprehensive R Archive Network", is the main server from which you'll download external packages. It provides an easy framework for distributing code (way better than passing around hundreds of links to GitHub repos).

To download and install packages, do the following:

```{r cranInstall, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Install packages + their dependencies with install.packages()
install.packages(c("data.table", "rbokeh", "purrr"),
                 dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports"))

# Load package namespace with library()
library(data.table)

# (A few months later...) Check CRAN for new versions of your packages
utils::update.packages()
```

<h2>Installing from GitHub</h2>

While there are [many many packages available from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), you may sometimes want to install directly from a source control site like GitHub. R developers will often release bleeding-edge ("dev") features on GitHub before they make it to CRAN.

```{r ghInstall, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Load deps
library(devtools)

# Install from GitHub
devtools::install_github(repo = "terrytangyuan/dml")

# Check where R put this package on your machine
find.package("dml")
```

<h2>Installing Local Code</h2>

On professional data science teams, you may find yourself passing around R packages on an internal file system.
    - see, for example: ["Using R packages and education to scale Data Science at Airbnb"](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/using-r-packages-and-education-to-scale-data-science-at-airbnb-906faa58e12d#.c3qbgjtdr)

To install R packages sitting on your file system, you can use `install_local()` from the `devtools` package.

<center><a href="https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/"><img src = "assets/img/week2_min_r_package.png"></a></center>

```{r install_local, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
devtools::install_local(path = "path/to/package")
```

<h2>Namespacing Calls</h2>

You may have noticed that I use `::` frequently in my code. Remember when we used `search()` to print the ordered list of namespaces that R searches for objects? `::` is used to circumvent this process. `lubridate::ymd_hms()` tells R *"Use the function ymd_hms from the 'lubridate' package"*

Without namespacing, R will search through the list of namespaces until it finds what it wants. When you load a new package that has a function with the same name as one already loaded in your session, R will warn you that that version has been "masked".

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, warning = TRUE}
library(lubridate)
```

```
Attaching package: 'lubridate'

The following object is masked from 'package:base':

    date
```

<h2>library() vs. require()</h2>

In this course, I've been using the `library()` command to load package namespaces. If you look around online, you will probably see many examples where people use `require()` instead.

**what's the difference?**
- `library()` is used in scripts. It will throw an *error* if you do not have the package
- `require()` is used in functions. It will throw a *warning* if you don't have the package
- <TEXT COLOR="red">Errors</TEXT> will break your code immediately, while <TEXT COLOR="purple">warnings</TEXT> will print a note but allow the code to keep running

```{r library_v_require, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, error = TRUE}
library(some_package_that_does_not_exist)

my_func <- function(n){
    require(some_package_that_does_not_exist)
    return("JaVale McGee!!!!")
}
```

<h2>Using Local Code with source()</h2>

There is one other option we have not discussed yet, in part because it doesn't technically involve the use of packages. Many analysts working in R prefer to define a file with their function and use `source()` to make those functions available to other scripts.

*** =left

**my_script.R**

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Load in your functions
soure_file <- file.path("my_helper_functions.R")
source(source_file)

# Run pipeline
myData <- createRandomData(100, "norm")
head(myData)
```

*** =right

**my_helper_functions.R**

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Function returning random nums
createRandomData <- function(n, dist){
    if (dist == "norm"){
        RAND_FUN <- rnorm
    } else {
        RAND_FUN <- rexp
    }
    return(RAND_FUN(n))
}
```

<h2>UDF Example</h2>

You can you user-defined functions to wrap arbitrarily complicated logic into concise statements. As mentioned in week 1, a good rule of thumb is to say "any time your find yourself copying and pasting the same code more than twice, write a function".

```{r udfExample, eval = FALSE}
# Given a number between 0 and 1, multiply by a random number
# between 0 and 1, then return an action based on quantile
weirdFunction <- function(num){
    rand_num    <- runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1)
    action_val  <- num*rand_num
    if (action_val <= 0.25){return("left")}
    if (action_val <= 0.5){return("right")}
    if (action_val <= 0.75){return("up")}
    return("down")
}
action_sequence <- sapply(runif(n = 100, min = 0, max = 1), weirdFunction)
action_sequence[1:20]
```

<h2>Functions That Return Stuff</h2>

As you've seen in previous examples, the R special word `return` tells a function to "give back" some value. When you execute an expression like `x <- someFunction()`, that function's return value (an R object) is stored in a variable called "x".

Unlike in some other programming languages, R allows you to use multiple `return` values inside the body of a function. The first time that the code inside the function reaches a `return` value, it will pass that value back out of the function and immediately stop executing the function.

<h2>Functions That Return Nothing</h2>

Not all functions have to return something! Sometimes you may want to create a function that just has some side effect like creating a plot, writing to a file, or print to the console.

These are called "null functions" and they're common in scripting languages like R. By default, these functions return the R special value `NULL`.

```{r nullFunc, eval = FALSE}
printSentence <- function(theSentence){
    words <- strsplit(x = theSentence, split = " ")
    for (word in words){
        print(word)
    }
}

# Assigning to an object is irrelevant...this function doesn't return anything
x <- printSentence("Hip means to know, it's a form of intelligence")
x
```

<h2>Brief Review of Scoping</h2>

Remember when we talked about namespaces and how R searches for objects? It's time to extend that logic to functions...which is where things get a bit weird and hard to understand.

R uses a search technique called [lexical scoping](http://bit.ly/2DlfkDi)

<h2>Sourcing Helper Functions</h2>

In the examples so far, I've been defining functions and using them in the same breath. As your projects grow in complexity, you will find this really tedious and hard to keep track of.

An alternative that many intermediate R programmers turn to is defining one or more `helperfuns.R` scripts to store custom functions and then using `source()` at the top of their run scripts to make those functions available in the main program.

<h2>Structured: Delimited Files</h2>

Out in the wild, one of the most common types of flat file you will find is a delimited file. In these files, bits of data are separated by a common character ("delimiter"). Common types include comma separated values (CSV), tab-separated values, and space-delimited. When these files are opened by a program like R, SAS, or Excel, those programs can figure out what the delimiter is and use it to split data into columns.

Let's look at an example: 

- Download some stock data from Quandl: https://www.quandl.com/api/v3/datasets/WIKI/AAPL.csv
- Navigate to wherever you stored the file
- Right click on the file, and use "Open With" to open it with sublime

<h2>Structured: Delimited Files</h2>

There are lots of options to read these types of files into R, but for the purposes of this class we will stick with `read.delim()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Store the path to your file in an object
dataPath <- file.path(
  Sys.getenv("HOME"), "repos", "my_project", "data", "project_data.csv"
)

# Read the file into a data.frame
dataDF <- read.delim(
    file = dataPath,
    header = TRUE,
    sep = ","
)
```

<h2>Semi-Structured: JSON Files</h2>

JSON ([JavaScript Object Notation](http://www.json.org/)) is a light-weight format for representing arbitrary data objects in text files. It is used by many applications and most programming languages have functionality to handle and parse it.

See the Elasticsearch documentation for an example (and a cool lesson on search technology!): https://www.elastic.co/blog/significant-terms-aggregation

See the [Week 2 Supplement](https://jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/code/Week2_Supplement.html) for an example using data from the State of Oregon's open data platform.

<h2>Unstructured: Text files</h2>

In the context of statistical programming, text files that are "unstructured" are those that do not have an obvious parallel in a data object like a data frame, vector, list, or key-value store. An example might be a large archive of tweets or a collection of court transcripts.

Working with these types of files typically involves reading them into R line-by line and then using something called [regular expression](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/regex.html) (basically just pattern-matching on strings) to extract relevant features like word counts. For example:

See the Shakespeare example in the [Week 2 Supplement](https://jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/code/Week2_Supplement.html) for some hands-on experience with this approach.
