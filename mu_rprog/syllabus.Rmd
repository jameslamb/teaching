# I. Course Info

Welcome to R Programming!

## A. Learning Objectives and Outcomes

In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of using the R programming language.

What you'll learn:

* syntax (i.e. "this is the command to do this thing in R")
* how to write complex R programs
* how to use R to read data, conduct statistical analyses and create data visualizations

## B. Course Resources and Communication

### Instructor

* **email:** jaylamb20@gmail.com
* **GitHub:** https://github.com/jameslamb
* **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameslamb1/

Email is my preferred contact method, and I will do my best to respond to all emails within 24 hours.

### Office Hours

Go to https://calendly.com/_jameslamb to book time for a 1-on-1 video call with me.
That service is automatically synced with my calendars.

If you don't see a time that works with your schedule, please email me with your availability and we can find a time to meet.

### Course Materials

No textbooks or other paid resources.

* course site: https://jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/
* lecture videos: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gxLk7hH5sPd8QaBwKY9QqabyWq3TXoAh
* programming supplement: https://jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/code/programming-supplement.html

All lectures are delivered asynchronously, via those pre-recorded videos.

**YOU WILL PRESENT YOUR FINAL PROJECT ON A VIDEO CALL SATURDAY, AUGUST 10, 9:00a-12:00P CT**.

Videos describing the solutions to quizzes and assignments will be made available after the deadlines for those items.

### Required Hardware

\textcolor{red}{You are required to use your own laptop for this class.}

If you do not have a personal laptop, please let me know as soon as possible.

The use of personal hardware is required because one of the objectives for this course is to help each of you set up a data science development environment on your own machines.

### Required Software

We will be working with the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/).
For script editing and exploratory analysis, we'll use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

Instructions for setting up these components can be found in the sections below.

## A. Quizzes (25\%)

There will be two quizzes which will test your understanding of topics covered in class.
In addition, quizzes may require you to interpret pseudo-code or to write a bit of R code yourself to solve questions.

Quizzes are delivered online via D2L (see the "Quizzes" section of the course site).
Quizzes have no time limit.
You will be allowed two attempts for each quiz and your grade on each quiz will be the better of your two scores.
All times below are in Central Time.

|Quiz                       |Opens                             |Due                      |

## B. Programming Assignments (30\%)

After we've covered preliminary topics in the first two weeks of the course, I'll ask you to complete two programming assignments.
In these assignments, you'll create R scripts to accomplish common tasks in data exploration and statistical analysis.

Assignment rubrics are available on the course site.

* Assignment 1 ([link](https://jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/assignments/programming_assignment1.html))
* Assignment 2 ([link](https://jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/assignments/programming_assignment2.html))

Your completed assignment must be uploaded to the appropriate folder in the "Dropbox" section on the course D2L page by the due date listed in the table below.
<br>

|Quiz                       |Opens                             |Due                       |

All times below are in Central Time.

## C. Final Project (45\%)

Unlike the quizzes and programming assignments, the final project will be relatively unstructured.
In this project, you will be asked to augment what you've learned about base R with other functionality available in external packages.
You will be responsible for building an end-to-end analysis in R...a script that gets/cleans real world data, creates some exploratory plots, executes some statistical analysis, and stores the results to a file for later re-use.

The project comprises the following parts:

1. *Final project proposal*: A 1-2 page briefing on your planned project
2. *Final project script*: The R script/scripts supporting your project
3. *Final project report*: A 2-4 page report detailing the outcome of your analysis
4. *Final project code review*: A 5-10 minute overview of your project, presented live in the final week of the course.

Full details of the project and each of its components are available at [https://jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/assignments/final_project.html](https://jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/assignments/final_project.html).
All times below are in Central Time.

|Assignment                              |Materials Available  | Due                        |

## D. Extra Credit

There is an optional Extra Credit assignment available, worth up to 3 percentage points on your final grade.
Follow the instructions at https://jameslamb.github.io/teaching/mu_rprog/assignments/extra-credit.html.

This extra credit must be submitted prior to midnight on August 15, 2024.

## E. Grade Appeal

The grading policies described above will be used to calculate your final grade for the course
Individual assignment grades will follow rubrics available on the course site.

If you disagree with any grade assigned to you in this course, please refer to this document and those rubrics in your appeal.

# III. Administrative Information

## A. Special Needs

Please inform me during the first week of class if you have any conditions that may limit or affect your ability to participate in this course so that we can make necessary arrangements.
You may also contact the Office of Student Disability Services (http://www.marquette.edu/disability-services/).

## B. Emergency Plan

See https://www.marquette.edu/university-safety/guides/emergency-planning.php.

## C. Attendance Statement

The Marquette University Graduate School of Management considers regular class attendance an important component of the learning process.
Students are expected to attend scheduled class meetings; excessive absences may have adverse consequences, ranging from a lowered course grade to forced withdrawal from the course.
Excessive absence is generally defined as missing more than 10-15 percent of the regularly scheduled class time.

For this course, anything more than 1 class period is determined to be "excessive".
Because this is a short (5-week) course, missing even one week will make it difficult to learn the material and satisfactorily complete the course requirements.
If you miss more than one class, your grade will be reduced by a full letter grade for each absence after the first.
All students are expected to complete all quizzes, assignments, and the final project.

The policy above applies to "unexcused" absences.
There are a handful of situations which are considered "excused" absences:

* legal obligations (such as jury duty)
* university-sanctioned activities and related travel
* religious observance

If you anticipate missing any classes, please let me know as early as possible so we can plan accordingly.

For more, see https://www.marquette.edu/business/graduate/current-policies.php.

## D. Academic Integrity

Don't cheat.

For more, see http://www.marquette.edu/provost/integrity-pledge.php.
